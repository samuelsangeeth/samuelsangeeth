1.  Vehicle to vehicle wireless charigng by alligning vehicles and transfering charges.
    makes more people buy evs and main reason to not buy ev in india is the lack of charging stations.
    solution for removing the anxiety of running out of charge while in the middle of nowhere.

2.  Solution to the Trolley Problem- 
    This scenario describes the ethical dilemma known as the "Trolley Problem" in the context of autonomous vehicles. The problem is:

    Problem Statement: "Design an autonomous vehicle's decision-making system to handle situations where the car must choose between two undesirable outcomes: harming the vehicle's occupants or harming a pedestrian. 
    Specifically, if the car is accelerating at a rate that prevents it from stopping in time for a crossing pedestrian, 
    the system must decide whether to swerve into a wall, potentially injuring or killing the passengers, or to continue forward, 
    potentially injuring or killing the pedestrian."

    Key Challenges:

    a. Ethical Decision-Making: How to program the car to make ethical decisions in unavoidable collision scenarios.


    b. Safety Prioritization: Determining whether the safety of the passengers or the pedestrian should take precedence.


    c. Legal and Moral Implications: Navigating the legal and moral responsibilities of the autonomous vehicle's behavior in such situations.
  

    d. Predictive Modelling: Developing systems that can predict and evaluate the consequences of different actions in real-time.


    e. Risk Minimization: Implementing strategies to reduce the likelihood of such scenarios arising.


    Problem can be solved by using a live sattellite feed in order to have coverage of every single vehicle and person and moving thing and given this information to the vehicle can easily avoid any collisions.
    even though tesla has tried to overcome this problem by implementing just cameras 360* around the vehicle.. it still dosent give the ev's software enough time to detect and react..
    so having a sattelite feed will give an early information on where and when the living beings are moving in order to avoid any unforseen circumstances.
